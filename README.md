## Ratings

Clerk can rate albums and tracks, which will be saved in MPDs sticker database as rating or albumrating.
Track ratings should be compatible with all other MPD clients that support them.
Albumratings are a unique feature to clerk, as far as I know.

It's also possible to store ratings in file tags. Currently this is supported for flac, ogg and mp3 files.
For this to work, simply set `tagging=true` in clerk.conf file and set your music_path.

Itâ€™s even possible to tag files not on the same machine (On MPD setups with remote clients).
Simply copy your clerk.conf and clerk_rating_client to the machine hosting your audio files and
make sure it runs there.

For the moment I use metaflac, mid3v2 and vorbiscomment to tag files, because I haven't found a good perl library
for tagging.

## Filtering

clerk integrates ratings fully into its database and exposes the ratings in track and album lists.
To filter by a specific rating use `r=n` as part of your input. Sadly filtering for `r=1` will also show `r=10`.
in rofi interface you can work around this by filtering for `r=1\s`. in fzf interface `r=1$` works.

If you don't like to see ratings in your track/album listings, simply increase the album_l setting in config.
